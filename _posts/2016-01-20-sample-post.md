title: "The Aylesbury estate's forgotten people"

We are the Aylesbury estate's forgotten people. The regeneration has forgotten us and we are being forced out with derisory compensation offers under compulsory purchase.

[Investigations by the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/20/aylesbury-estate-ruling-future-regeneration-sajid-javid) have shown how the Council as paying as little as £75k for a large (47m2) 1-bed flat, when equivalent ex-council properties in the area are selling for five times this amount.

The Council says we can take up a 'shared equity' option on the new housing association homes being built on the estate, but these come with restrictions in the small print limiting a number of things like: succession rights, capital uplift, assignment rights, subletting clauses. We are also forced to sign [confidentiality agreements](https://halag.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/confidentiality_agreement.pdf) preventing us from talking about the restrictive clauses in the lease.

It comes as no surprise that [only 6 of the 285 leaseholders](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/aylesbury_estate_regeneration_de#incoming-1055033) decanted from the estate to date have taken up this shared equity deal.

During the initial consultation on the regeneration of the estate, leaseholders were offered a ‘like-for-like’ swap – i.e. the option of swapping the lease on their home on the Aylesbury for an equivalent size council-owned property elsewhere in the borough. This guarantee was [enshrined in formal Council policy](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/1850/executive_report) at the time and detailed in the Council's [handbook for leaseholders](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/331856/response/818864/attach/3/64145%20RedR%20Homeowner.pdf).

However, the like-for-like option was later removed from policy shortly after the decant commenced. The Council has made no clear explanation as to why it was removed and has given no substantive reason for rejecting our repeated requests to have it reinstated. 

We have been fighting the Council's attempt to evict us using compulsory purchase powers and we scored a major victory in Sep 2016, when the Secretary of State [announced] that he would be blocking Southwark’s application for the CPO, on the grounds that the scheme is in breach of our basic human and equalities rights. The Secretary of State’s decision was based on the fact that many elderly leaseholders and those from black and ethnic minority groups were being forced to relocate elsewhere, rather than being rehoused on the scheme footprint.
