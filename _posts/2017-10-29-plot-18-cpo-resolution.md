title: "Council's Cabinet convenes to approve issuing CPO but fails to inform residents"

On Thursday 26 October 2017, one of the leaseholders of properties within the 57-76 Northchurch block on the Aylesbury estate, were informed by an acquaintance that Southwark Council is setting in motion the process to compulsory purchase our homes. 

It was discovered that at the upcoming Southwark Cabinet meeting, scheduled for Tuesday 31 October at 4PM, a report to seek authorisation to begin the Compulsory Purchase Order process for three properties within the Northchurch block will be presented.

We, the leaseholders, did not receive a formal notification from the Council that the future of our homes will be discussed at the meeting. The Council is under no legal obligation to do so, but we maintain that it would a matter of good practice on behalf of a public authority, to communicate with us concerned parties in a timely and clear manner, one that will allow us to respond and deliver our comments and objections within the established deadlines.

Because of this lack of communication from Southwark Council, we missed the deadline to put in a deputation to present our objections and concerns to the Cabinet. We have therefore have put in a late application request to Council leader Peter John, and are awaiting his response. 

If successful, on Tuesday we will outline our objections to the request to begin the process to Compulsory Purchase our homes. If Councillor John refuses our request, we will nonetheless attend the meeting, together with our families, supporters and friends. 

Our objections are as follows: 

The Compulsory Purchase of the 57-76 Northchurch block is part of the phase of the Aylesbury Regeneration know as "Plot 18". The site is vacant at present, for the exception of the block in question. The block houses 3 leaseholders, and almost all the remaining flats are let to temporary tenants. We object to the need to vacate and demolish our block on the following grounds: 

1. The Design and Access document for Plot 18 clearly shows that the land where 57-76 Northchurch is located, will be used for a temporary parking space. We argue the purpose of using the land as a temporary car park, is not a strong enough reason to compulsory purchase our homes. 

2. The Report that is up for discussion on Tuesday states that _"An application has been submitted to amend the consented tenure mix for Plot 18 in line with the revised tenure mix reported to cabinet in May 2017”_. Having checked the planning register today, we see no application _“submitted to amend the consented tenure mix for Plot 18.”_ (point 1, page 94)

3. The planning application seeks to reduce the number of social rented homes in this phase, well below the previous approved tenure mix and well below the 37.5% minimum requirement in the Council's planning policy.

Please join us to rally against the Council's compulsory purchase of our homes at its Cabinet meeting on Tuesday 31 October 4pm - Council HQ 160 Tooley St SE1 2QH.
