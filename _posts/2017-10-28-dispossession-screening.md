On Saturday 11th November 2017 we are helping to host the screening of 'Dispossession'; a film about council estate demolitions, including a number of speakers at Cambridge House, nearby Addington Square. 

On 8th December 2017 we are assisting with the premiere of ['Concrete Soldiers'](http://www.concretesoldiers.uk/) at the Elephant & Castle's [Cinema Museum](http://www.cinemamuseum.org.uk/) - a film about the Aylesbury regeneration, its beneficiaries and its discontents. 

Please come along to these screenings and support our camaign - all donations will go towards our [fees in fighting the legal case](https://www.gofundme.com/aylesbury-the-right-to-a-community-2uefgf2s) against the Council's ongoing attempts to evict us.
