Thank you to all those who came to and helped make our [film night on 11th November](http://ouraylesbury.org/page2/) a success and for all of the generous donations received.

We managed to raise a total of £1,155 from the event, which will be added to the £12,000 we have raised so far in our [crowdfunding fund](https://www.gofundme.com/aylesbury-the-right-to-a-community-2uefgf2s) for fighting our landmark legal case against the compulsory purchase order. The public inquiry starts on 9th January 2018 and will last for three whole weeks so we still need more funds to pay for our barrister at the inquiry.

To help raise more funds local filmmaker [Nikki Woolfe](http://www.woolfe.vision) has teamed up with beatboxer BELLATRIX and poet POTENTWHISPER to host a film screening event and discussion at the Cinema Museum on 8th December 2017. Nikki's film ['Concrete Soldiers'](http://concretesoldiers.co.uk) charts the Aylesbury regeneration and its discontents, and features some of us in the film. Nikki has beeen filming on the estate for several years and this is the premiere of her film, which provides a valuable insight into the lives of those affected by regeneration and ongoing fight to stay put.
