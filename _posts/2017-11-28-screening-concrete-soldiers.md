title: "Concrete Soldiers - film screening fundraiser"
---
Thank you to all those who came to and helped make our [film night on 11th November](http://ouraylesbury.org/page2/) a success and for all of the generous donations received.

We managed to raise a total of £1,155 from the event, which will be added to the £12,000 we have raised so far from our [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/aylesbury-the-right-to-a-community-2uefgf2s) to fight our ongoing landmark legal case. The public inquiry starts on 9th January 2018 and will last for three whole weeks and because we have no less than 23 expert witnesses giving supporting evidence, we still need more funds to pay for our barrister to be present throughout and draft all relevant legal submissions.

To help raise more funds local filmmaker [Nikki Woolfe](http://www.woolfe.vision) has teamed up with beatboxer BELLATRIX and poet POTENTWHISPER to host a film screening event and discussion at the [Cinema Museum](http://www.cinemamuseum.org.uk/) on 8th December 2017. Nikki's film ['Concrete Soldiers'](http://concretesoldiers.co.uk) charts the Aylesbury regeneration and its discontents, and features many of us in the film. Nikki has beeen filming on the estate for several years and this is the premiere of her film, which provides a valuable insight into the lives of those affected by regeneration and our ongoing fight to stay put.

The screening will be followed by performances from beatboxer BELLATRIX and poet POTENT WHISPER, followed by a discussion. Tickets are available online here: [http://concretesoldiers.uk/8dec.html](http://concretesoldiers.uk/8dec.html)

Thanks again to everyone for their ongoing support and look forward to seeing you at the screening on 8th Dec.
