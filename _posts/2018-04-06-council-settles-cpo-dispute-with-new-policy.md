On 16 March 2018, as a direct consequence of the Aylesbury Leaseholders Group’s (ALAG)
representations to the January 2018 public inquiry, Southwark Council changed its policy to
introduce an 'equity loan' scheme for leaseholders on regeneration estates.
This scheme meets most, if not all of the policy requirements that ALAG maintained at the public
inquiry were necessary to mitigate the effects of gentrification and displacement of leaseholders in
regeneration schemes.
As a result of Southwark's welcome change of policy, the ALAG and Southwark have settled the
dispute between them on terms which are based on the new policy decision.
The effect of ALAG's representations to the public inquiry has produced a favourable outcome for
the Aylesbury leaseholders and it is hoped that the new policy change represents the beginning of
local authorities recognising that the rights of leaseholders must be properly addressed in
regeneration schemes both London and nation-wide.

ALAG will be submitting the new equity loan policy to the Mayor of London for inclusion in his Good Practice Guide to Estate Regeneration.
Beverley Robinson one of the statutory objectors said ‘We are satisfied with the outcome. It has
been a long, hard struggle and we are pleased to have secured a settlement that will help
leaseholders across the Aylesbury and Southwark and hopefully across London.’
Background

The regeneration of the Aylesbury estate is a one of the most high-profile and controversial of the many council estate regeneration schemes taking place in London.

The current compulsory purchase order (CPO) is for the latest phase of the development and
involves the demolition of 566 homes. In September 2016 the Secretary of State for the Department
of Communities and Local Government, Sajid Javed, refused to confirm the CPO following a public
inquiry.

This decision was appealed and quashed and the SoS ordered a fresh public inquiry, which is
currently adjourned. The Aylesbury estate was built in the 1960’s and 70’s and was originally home to 2700 council tenants and their families. Demolition began in 2009 and about 2000 homes remain, including around 230 leaseholders.
