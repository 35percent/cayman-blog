## Save OUR Aylesbury from THEIR regeneration
We are fighting to save our community from a top-down regeneration that is [forcing us out with derisory compensation offers](http://heygatewashome.org/img/SNWolverton.pdf) using [compulsory purchase orders](http://heygatewashome.org/img/SouthwarkNews9July2014.pdf).

[Investigations by the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/20/aylesbury-estate-ruling-future-regeneration-sajid-javid) have shown how the Council is paying as little as £75k for a large (47m2) 1-bed flat, when equivalent ex-council properties in the area are selling for five times this amount.

The Council says we can take up a 'shared equity' option on the new housing association homes being built on the estate, but these come with restrictions in the small print limiting a number of things like: succession rights, capital uplift, assignment rights, subletting clauses. We are also forced to sign [confidentiality agreements](https://halag.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/confidentiality_agreement.pdf) preventing us from talking about the restrictive clauses in the lease. Read more about the shared equity deal [here..](http://ouraylesbury.org/shared-equity-small-print/)

It comes as no surprise that [only 6 of the 285 leaseholders](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/aylesbury_estate_regeneration_de#incoming-1055033) decanted from the estate to date have taken up this shared equity deal.

We have been [fighting](http://35percent.org/2015-05-02-aylesbury-estate-compulsory-purchase-order-public-inquiry/) the Council's [attempt to evict us](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-29098960) using compulsory purchase powers and last year we scored a major victory when the Secretary of State [rejected](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/16/government-blocks-controversial-plan-to-force-out-housing-estate-residents) Southwark’s application for CPO powers in a landmark legal decision. The secretary of state [said](http://35percent.org/img/Decision_Letter_Final.pdf) that our basic human and equalities rights were being breached by the Council as a result of many elderly leaseholders and those from black and ethnic minority groups were being forced to relocate because of the scheme.
